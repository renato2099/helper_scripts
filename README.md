Helper Scripts to run a cluster

These scripts use [parallel-ssh](https://github.com/pkittenis/parallel-ssh) to run commands on a cluster.
To run them parallel-ssh needs to be installed. To do so, run:

```bash
pip install parallel-ssh
```

Or as a user:

```bash
pip install --user parallel-ssh
```
